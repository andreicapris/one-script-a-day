This script is intended to repeat a system command until alloted time is over or an interrupt (Ctrl-C) is present. 
I wanted a little script that could repeatedly show me the battery status of a connected device through ADB. 
In order for this to run correctly you platform-tools from android or adb should be added in the environment variables PATH.
