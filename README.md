# one-script-a-day
This repository is intended as a collection of scripts inspired by the courses from Google relating to IT support and IT automation. 
As this is a collection of scripts it is intended more as an exercise in consistency from my part. 
I would like to see if I can consistently write code for a longer period of time.
